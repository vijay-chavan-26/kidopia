						<h4 style="color:black; font-size:50px;">Child Psychology</h4>
						<h1 style="text-align:left">Complicated yet very important topic!</h1><br>
						<h3>Dear parents,</h3><br>
						<p style="color:black; margin-right:200px;" >Getting to know your child as they develop can be one of the most rewarding parts of being a parent. Learning how your child views the world, teaching your child new skills, and mentoring them as they process big new feelings and changes is all part of being a parent, but it’s not easy.
							As your child develops, they go through progressive developmental stages, from birth into adulthood. Environmental, genetic, and cultural factors can all affect a child’s development, and how quickly they progress from one stage to the next.
							It’s difficult for children to explain what they’re going through, much less to analyze their feelings. That’s where child psychology can help give you highly important and valuable information on your child’s mental, physical, cognitive, and emotional health as they grow.
							 </p><br>
						<p><b>What Is Child Psychology?</b><br>
							Child psychology is the study of subconscious and conscious childhood development.
							 Child psychologists observe how a child interacts with their parents, themselves, and the world, to understand their mental development.
							</p>	<br>
							<p><b> Why Is It Important?	</b><br>
								Everyone wants their child to have healthy development, but it’s not always clear if a child’s behaviour is a symptom of a normal stage in development or a sign of an abnormality. Child psychologists can help you understand the difference. Understanding the normal and abnormal psychological patterns of a child can help parents understand how to best communicate and connect with their child, teach their child coping mechanisms for managing emotions, and help their child progress and thrive in each new developmental stage.
						    </p> <br>
                          
							<p><b>Just Psychological development is not enough! Physical development is also very important.</b></p>
							<p><br>
								<b>Physical Development-</b><br>
Physical development in children is typically a predictable sequence of events. Your child holds their head up, rolls over, crawls, walks, and runs, in that order. Your Child Psychologist can aid your paediatrician in observing your child’s physical development, and if there are any abnormalities that could indicate developmental irregularities. Child Psychologists will observe your child’s progression toward the milestones of development to ensure that your child is physically developing normally. Major delays in physical development may reveal other underlying developmental issues that can then be addressed early on.
Being little strict with your child is absolutely alright because letting your child on loose can also create some serious issues. Parents want their children to listen to them so they apply some strict rules on them which makes the child to visualize them as an evil. Being moderate strict is very important for parents, as children have to have discipline in their life. To keep your child in discipline there should be some strategies which indeed are useful. 
                            </p><br>

							<p>
								<b>1.	Show and tell.</b><br> Teach children right from wrong with calm words and actions. Model behaviours you would like to see in your children.<br>
<b>2.	Set limits.</b><br> Have clear and consistent rules your children can follow. Be sure to explain these rules in age-appropriate terms they can understand.<br>
<b>3.	Give consequences.</b><br> Calmly and firmly explain the consequences if they don't behave. For example, tell her that if she does not pick up her toys, you will put them away for the rest of the day. Be prepared to follow through right away. Don't give in by giving them back after a few minutes. But remember, never take away something your child truly needs, such as a meal.<br>
<b>4.	Hear them out.</b><br> Listening is important. Let your child finish the story before helping solve the problem. Watch for times when misbehavior has a pattern, like if your child is feeling jealous. Talk with your child about this rather than just giving consequences.
<br><b>5.	Give them your attention. </b><br>The most powerful tool for effective discipline is attention—to reinforce good behaviors and discourage others. Remember, all children want their parent's attention.
<br><b>6.	Catch them being good.</b><br> Children need to know when they do something bad--and when they do something good. Notice good behavior and point it out, praising success and good tries. Be specific (for example, "Wow, you did a good job putting that toy away!").
<br><b>7.	Know when not to respond.</b><br> As long as your child isn't doing something dangerous and gets plenty of attention for good behavior, ignoring bad behavior can be an effective way of stopping it. Ignoring bad behavior can also teach children natural consequences of their actions. For example, if your child keeps dropping her cookies on purpose, she will soon have no more cookies left to eat. If she throws and breaks her toy, she will not be able to play with it. It will not be long before she learns not to drop her cookies and to play carefully with her toys.
<br><b>8.	Be prepared for trouble.</b><br> Plan ahead for situations when your child might have trouble behaving. Prepare them for upcoming activities and how you want them to behave.
<br><b>9.	Redirect bad behavior.</b><br> Sometimes children misbehave because they are bored or don't know any better. Find something else for your child to do.
<br><b>10.	Call a time-out.</b><br> A time-out can be especially useful when a specific rule is broken. This discipline tool works best by warning children they will get a time out if they don't stop, reminding them what they did wrong in as few words―and with as little emotion―as possible, and removing them from the situation for a pre-set length of time (1 minute per year of age is a good rule of thumb). With children who are at least 3 years old, you can try letting their children lead their own time-out instead of setting a timer. You can just say, "Go to time out and come back when you feel ready and in control." This strategy, which can help the child learn and practice self-management skills, also works well for older children and teens.

								<b>Spanking and harsh words are harmful and don't work. Here's why:</b><br>
								The AAP policy statement, "Effective Discipline to Raise Healthy Children," highlights why it's important to focus on teaching good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior. Research shows that spanking, slapping and other forms of physical punishment don't work well to correct a child's behavior. The same holds true for yelling at or shaming a child. Beyond being ineffective, harsh physical and verbal punishments can also damage a child's long-term physical and mental health.
                            </p>
							<br>
							<p>
								<b>•	Spanking's unhealthy cycle.</b><br> The AAP advises that parents and caregivers should not spank or hit children. Instead of teaching responsibility and self-control, spanking often increases aggression and anger in children. A study of children born in 20 large U.S. cities found that families who used physical punishment got caught in a negative cycle: the more children were spanked, the more they later misbehaved, which prompted more spankings in response. Spanking's effects may also be felt beyond the parent-child relationship. Because it teaches that causing someone pain is OK if you're frustrated—even with those you love. Children who are spanked may be more likely to hit others when they don't get what they want.<b>
                               </b><br>Physical punishment increases the risk of injury, especially in children under 18 months of age, and may leave other measurable marks on the brain and body. Children who are spanked show higher levels of hormones tied to toxic stress. Physical punishment may also affect brain development. One study found that young adults who were spanked repeatedly had less gray matter, the part of the brain involved with self-control, and performed lower on IQ tests as young adults than the control group.

                               <br><b>•	Verbal abuse: How words hurt.</b><br> Yelling at children and using words to cause emotional pain or shame also has been found to be ineffective and harmful. Harsh verbal discipline, even by parents who are otherwise warm and loving, can lead to more misbehavior and mental health problems in children. Research shows that harsh verbal discipline, which becomes more common as children get older, may lead to more behavior problems and symptoms of depression in teens.<br>
                               <b>•	Lasting marks. </b><br>Physical punishment increases the risk of injury, especially in children under 18 months of age, and may leave other measurable marks on the brain and body. Children who are spanked show higher levels of hormones tied to toxic stress. Physical punishment may also affect brain development. One study found that young adults who were spanked repeatedly had less gray matter, the part of the brain involved with self-control, and performed lower on IQ tests as young adults than the control group.
